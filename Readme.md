#SharedBookmarks

This project intends to gather every bookmark used by a group - enterprise - or association in one place: a chrome extension. Despite being a simple idea, it can be powerful if it's used in an organized way. A great way to share any tutorial/paper/link you might think it's necessary that your group knows.
